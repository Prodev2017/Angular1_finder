                        <p>False Creek is one of Vancouver’s most picturesque and upcoming waterfront neighbourhoods. The south boundary of West 6th Avenue (which goes from being West 4th from Burrard Street to under the Granville Bridge where it turns into West 6th before becoming West 2nd at the Cambie Street Bridge underpass) is naturally balanced by the northern boundary of the False Creek waterway. Burrard Street on the west and Ontario Street on the east squares off and completes the defined borders of the area.</p>
                        <p>False Creek can proudly boast some of the most well-known areas of Vancouver including Granville Island, the Olympic Village, Seaforth Armoury and Molson Breweries.</p>
                        <p>The area was named after the waterway of False Creek which separates downtown from the rest of the city. It was originally named by George Henry Richards during his hydrographic survey of 1856-63. The Telus World of Science visually anchors the eastern boundary while the iconic Art Deco Burrard Street Bridge visibly anchors the area on the west. During WW1, the easternmost part of False Creek actually extended all the way to Clark Drive but it was filled in by Great Northern Railway and Canadian Northern Pacific Railway in order to create the land needed for their yards and rail terminals.</p>
                        <p>False Creek was the industrial heartland of Vancouver in the 1950s consisting of sawmills and small port operations among others. In the 1960s a UBC geography professor envisioned the transformation of this site from industrial into a mixed use waterfront community. In 1968 Mr. Hardwick was elected to City Council and spearheaded the city’s redevelopment team and helped secure the participation of the federal government in the transformation planning. This was an important component since the federal government owned Granville Island. Priorities for this area – agreed upon in the design process and backed by public input – included an accessible waterfront seawall, mixed tenure housing including condos, co-op and low income housing, live-aboard marinas and a vibrant waterfront market. The plans were formalized in 1972 as the “Official Development Plan” and outlined that 1/3 of the site would be set aside for housing (with a density of 40 units per acre) with the balance of the land converted to parks, waterfront and community uses. 1991 saw a redefinition by City Council with the challenge to create a community that is the “model of sustainability, incorporating forward thinking infrastructure, strategic energy reduction, high</p>
